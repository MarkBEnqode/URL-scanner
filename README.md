This code is a tool for efficiently fetching data from multiple URLs while avoiding overloading the server or being blocked. Here's a basic explanation of what each part does:

1. Importing Libraries
axios: A library for making HTTP requests, used here to fetch data from URLs.
p-limit: A library to control the number of simultaneous requests (concurrency).
2. Delaying Execution
delay(ms): A helper function that pauses the execution for a specified time (ms). This is used to introduce a gap between batches of requests to make the process slower and less likely to trigger server protections.
3. Fetching URLs with Concurrency (fetchUrls)
Purpose: Fetches data from a list of URLs while:

Limiting the number of simultaneous requests.
Introducing delays to mimic human-like behavior.
Steps:

Concurrency Control:
Uses p-limit to ensure only a specified number of requests (concurrency) run at the same time.
Delays Between Batches:
After every batch of concurrency requests, it pauses for delayMs milliseconds to avoid overwhelming the server.
Fetching Data:
Each URL is fetched using axios. Headers include a rotating User-Agent to make requests appear as if they're coming from different browsers.
If a request fails (e.g., network issue or server block), it logs the error and moves on to the next URL.
Returns:

A dictionary (allDatas) where each URL is a key, and its fetched HTML data is the value.
4. Random User-Agent Generator (getRandomUserAgent)
Purpose: Mimics requests from various browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
How It Works:
It randomly selects a User-Agent string from a predefined list of popular browser identifiers.
This makes each request appear unique and reduces the likelihood of being flagged as a bot.
5. Key Features
Concurrency Management: Limits the number of requests running at the same time to avoid overloading servers.
Delays: Introduces gaps between batches of requests to reduce detection.
Error Handling: Logs failed requests but ensures the process continues.
User-Agent Rotation: Makes requests appear as if they come from different devices/browsers.
Use Case
If you have a list of URLs and want to fetch their data without being flagged or blocked by servers, this code allows you to do so efficiently and responsibly.
